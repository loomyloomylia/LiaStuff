One idea is that I could do muted colors for when talon is in sleep mode out of any other mode
 this would distinguish it from being totally dark like when it was malfunctioning
 
 could do trans colors for command mode
 
    and then could do lesbian colors for game mode
 I think I want to use the ram sticks as the super mode indicator and the fan is the sub mode indicator ingame
  it would match the ram sticks any other time
  
Could do the poly flag for dictation mode
